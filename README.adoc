vimrc
=====

This is my personal vimrc and a collection of bundles it uses. It also
includes pathogen.vim because, really, it's the only simple bundle
script I could think to use (alternatives aren't all that great).

Nothing to really see here that's special.


Installation
------------

To install this, check this repository out into '$HOME/.vim' and then
source ''$HOME/.vim/vimrc' from '$HOME/.vimrc'.

This is intended to keep the vim files fairly isolated and ensure that
'$HOME/.vimrc' can be used to set machine-specific things.

I should probably also add something to swap out the use of Esc keys,
but that's not a priority.
